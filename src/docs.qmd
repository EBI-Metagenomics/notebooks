## MGnify Documentation
MGnify is a freely available hub for the analysis and exploration of [metagenomic](docs/glossary.md#Metagenomic), [metatranscriptomic](docs/glossary.md#Metatranscriptomic), [amplicon](docs/glossary.md#Amplicon) and [assembly](docs/glossary.md#Assembly) data. 

The resource provides rich functional and taxonomic analyses of user-submitted sequences, as well as analysis of publicly available metagenomic datasets held within the European Nucleotide Archive ([ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena)).

This is MGnify's documentation resource, providing guides to use the MGnify website, API, and submission services.

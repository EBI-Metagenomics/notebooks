# About

## The MGnify service

MGnify is a freely available hub for the analysis and exploration of [metagenomic](glossary.md#term-Metagenomic), [metatranscriptomic](glossary.md#term-Metatranscriptomic), [amplicon](glossary.md#term-Amplicon) and [assembly](glossary.md#term-Assembly) data. The resource provides rich functional and taxonomic analyses of user-submitted sequences, as well as analysis of publicly available metagenomic datasets held within the European Nucleotide Archive ([ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena)). The MGnify resource was previously known as EBI Metagenomics, but was re-branded in 2018 to reflect its growing remit.

## What does MGnify offer

**Powerful analysis**

    MGnify offers multiple analysis pipelines that are tailored according to input data (amplicon, raw read or assembly), providing (where appropriate) detailed taxonomic and functional analysis of microbiome sequence data.

**Access to an extensive selection of analysed data**

    MGnify houses a vast repository of analysed microbiome datasets, processed using standardized pipelines and workflows, allowing analyses to be placed in context with other studies from similar environments.

**Programmatic access to analysed data**

    In addition to visualisations available from the website and downloadable results files, MGnify analyses can be queried and retrieved via a RESTful API, giving full programmatic access to the data.

**Archiving of user-submitted data**

    Through partnership with the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), user-submitted sequence data and metadata is archived. Accession numbers are supplied as part of this process, which is a prerequisite for publication in many journals.

**Standards-compliant data**

    Submission tools help ensure sequence data and metadata comply with ENA data schemes and the Genomic Standards Consortium ([GSC](https://press3.mcs.anl.gov/gensc/)) metadata guidelines, allowing harmonisation of analysis efforts across the wider genomics community.

## Funding

Current funding:
MGnify currently receives funding support from: the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme (817729, 862923, and 952914) and Research Infrastructures programme (824087); the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/S009043/1, BB/T000902/1, BB/V01868X/1, and BB/W002965/1); ELIXIR, the research infrastructure for Life-Science data; EMBL – FNR (CORE International); and European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) core funds.

Previous funding:
MGnify was initiated with institutional funding from EMBL. It gratefully acknowledges previous funding received from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/M011755/1 and BB/I02612X/1), the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme (676559 and 654008), Innovate UK (102513) and the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for Research (287589).

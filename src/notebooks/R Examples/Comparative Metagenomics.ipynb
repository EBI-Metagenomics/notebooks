    "An approximately 10-fold difference in the library sizes means that we will need to apply a normalization method before continuing with the analysis. The most common normalization methods used in microbiome count data are proportions and rarefaction. However, other methods originally developed to normalize RNA-seq counts have been adapted to differential-abundance analysis in microbiome data. A discussion about how to choose the right normalization method is out of the scope of this material, but the topic has been covered in multiple forums and scientific publications. Depending on the downstream analysis we intend to perform, different methods might be appropriate. For instance, to compare groups of samples at community-level through beta-diversity, \"...proportions and rarefying produced more accurate comparisons among communities and are the only methods that fully normalized read depths across samples. Additionally, upper quartile, cumulative sum scaling (CSS), edgeR-TMM, and DESeq-VS often masked differences among communities when common OTUs differed, and they produced false positives when rare OTUs differed\" ([2](#reference_2)). On the other hand, for detection of differentially abundant species, \"both proportions and rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests for species that are differentially abundant across sample classes\" ([3](#reference_3)).\n",

    "In the following examples we will show three popular ways of normalization: relative abundance, rarefaction and cummulative sum scaling."

    "There are many approaches out there to detect differentially abundant taxa (or genes). Here we are using the method implemented in `SIAMCAT` library. `SIAMCAT` is an R package that puts together statistical functions to compare large-scale studies in order to detect microbial community composition changes due to environmental factors. Describing such associations in quantitative models has multiple applications, such as in predicting disease status based on microbiome data. In addition, the pipeline includes the generation of high-quality plots for visual inspection of results ([9](#reference_9)). There are multiple parameters that can be adjusted for better performance in each step of the analysis. However, in this exercise we are using default arguments with minimal tuning."

# Set permissions on a directory
# After any installation, if a directory needs to be (human) user-writable, run this script on it.
# It will make everything in the directory owned by the group ${NB_GID} and writable by that group.
# Deployments that want to set a specific user id can preserve permissions
# by adding the `--group-add users` line to `docker run`.

# Uses find to avoid touching files that already have the right permissions,
# which would cause a massive image explosion

# Right permissions are:
# group=${NB_GID}
# AND permissions include group rwX (directory-execute)
# AND directories have setuid,setgid bits set
